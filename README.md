# Client

This is a web application built using Vite, React, Node.js, and Express.

## Frontend
To start working on this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd Client/frontend
  ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

4. Start the frontend development server:

  ```bash

5. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend directory:

  ```bash
  cd ../backend
  ```

6. Install backend dependencies:

  ```bash
